# ðŸš€ Complete Railway Deployment Guide for Antaali ERP Backend

## Step 1: Install Prerequisites

### Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
1. Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install the LTS version (includes npm)
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

### Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your Backend

Your backend is already configured with:
- âœ… `package.json` with all dependencies
- âœ… `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation
- âœ… `Dockerfile` for containerization
- âœ… `railway.toml` for Railway configuration
- âœ… `nixpacks.toml` for build configuration
- âœ… `.env.production` for production environment variables

## Step 3: Deploy to Railway

### 3.1 Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
```
This will open your browser to authenticate with Railway.

### 3.2 Initialize Railway Project
```bash
cd backend
railway init
```
Choose:
- Create a new project
- Name it "antaali-erp-backend"

### 3.3 Add PostgreSQL Database
```bash
railway add postgresql
```
This creates a PostgreSQL database instance for your project.

### 3.4 Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Generate and set JWT secret
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Set Node environment
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production

# Set your frontend URL for CORS (replace with your actual frontend URL)
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Optional: Set port (Railway sets this automatically)
railway variables set PORT=3001
```

### 3.5 Deploy Your Backend
```bash
railway up
```

This will:
1. Upload your code to Railway
2. Build your TypeScript project
3. Start your Express server
4. Provide you with a deployment URL

## Step 4: Post-Deployment Setup

### 4.1 Run Database Migrations
After deployment, initialize your database:
```bash
railway run npm run migrate
```

### 4.2 Create Initial Admin User
You can create an admin user by making a POST request to:
```
POST https://your-project.up.railway.app/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "admin",
  "email": "admin@antaali.com",
  "password": "your-secure-password",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

## Step 5: Test Your Deployment

### Health Check
Visit: `https://your-project.up.railway.app/health`

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### API Endpoints
Your backend provides these endpoints:

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile

**Perfumes:**
- `GET /api/perfumes` - List all perfumes
- `POST /api/perfumes` - Create perfume (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/perfumes/:id` - Update perfume (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/perfumes/:id` - Delete perfume (Admin only)

**Orders:**
- `GET /api/orders` - Get orders (filtered by user role)
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
- `PUT /api/orders/:id` - Update order status (Admin only)

**Stores:**
- `GET /api/stores` - List stores
- `POST /api/stores` - Create store (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/stores/:id` - Update store (Admin only)

**Workers:**
- `GET /api/workers` - List workers
- `POST /api/workers` - Create worker (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/workers/:id` - Update worker (Admin only)

## Step 6: Connect Your Frontend

Update your frontend to use the Railway backend URL:

```typescript
// In your frontend config
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-project.up.railway.app/api';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failures:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```
   Check for TypeScript compilation errors.

2. **Database Connection Issues:**
   Ensure PostgreSQL service is running:
   ```bash
   railway status
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   Check all variables are set:
   ```bash
   railway variables
   ```

4. **CORS Issues:**
   Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly for your frontend domain.

### Useful Commands:
- `railway logs` - View application logs
- `railway status` - Check service status
- `railway variables` - List environment variables
- `railway open` - Open project in browser
- `railway domain` - Manage custom domains

## Security Notes

1. **JWT Secret:** Generated automatically with secure random string
2. **Database:** Automatically secured by Railway
3. **HTTPS:** Automatically provided by Railway
4. **Rate Limiting:** Built into the application
5. **Input Validation:** All endpoints have validation middleware

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Deploy backend to Railway
2. ðŸ”„ Update frontend to use Railway backend URL
3. ðŸ§ª Test all API endpoints
4. ðŸ“Š Set up monitoring and alerts
5. ðŸš€ Deploy frontend to production

Your Antaali ERP backend is now ready for production! ðŸŽ‰
